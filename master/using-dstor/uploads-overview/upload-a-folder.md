# Upload a Folder

From your dashboard, in addition to uploading files, you may also upload entire folders. This can be done two ways.&#x20;

1\. Users may drag and drop a folder from your computer to your dashboard and the folder and its content will be uploaded, with each file being hashed individually.

2\. Users may also use the upload interface by clicking the blue Upload button. This uploads the entire folder and hashes the folder. This means the contents of the folder become uneditable.

Selecting the "Folder" option allows users to upload and hash and entire folder. The files within the folder cannot be deleted individually or edited in any way. \


Organizing your data is important for many types of projects. To move items into a directory, simply create a new directory and then upload the desired files to that directory. An upcoming feature will allow users to drag and drop files between directories and select files and move them to different directories.&#x20;
