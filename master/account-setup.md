Fill out your name, email, website, and tell us briefly about your storage needs. Once youâ€™ve filled everything out, click the Request button. You will receive a confirmation of your request via email with more information. When your request is approved, you will receive another email invitation from dStor with a link and a account key to set your password and create your account.  Upon sign up you will be required to input a payment method that will be automatically billed.  For more information about billing refer to the [Paying for dStor](../paying-for-dstor/) documentation section.

After that, you will be able to login with your credentials any time and begin using dStor!
