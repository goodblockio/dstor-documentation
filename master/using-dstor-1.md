# Start with the API

[Follow the documentation here to integrate your application with dStor by doing the following:](https://api.dstor.cloud/v1/docs/index.html#/)

1. Creating an API Key (Optional)
2. Using your dStor account login credentials OR using the API key to acquire a temporary access token
3. Attaching the temporary access token to upload requestâ€‹

The purpose of using the temporary access token model is to reduce reads to the dStor database, thereby ensuring that the system is able to remain performant even with a large number of users and dapps uploading content.
