# Quick Start

Getting started with dStor with either option requires a dStor account and currently, while we are in a Closed Beta, both Node Operators and Users (Developers/Customers) are strategically approved and added to optimize the experience for everyone. This means we are adding users and node operators to ensure we have enough storage capacity and location diversity to deliver the best dStor experience.  _**Requesting an invite is not a guarantee of receiving access right away.**_ \

_**Note: if there are issues with your sign-up request, you maybe contacted for more information.**_ \
\
dStor is a B2B platform where most users are expected to utilize api connections for file interactions.  However, there are exceptions for some B2B users like NFT platforms that make use of the Portal.  Whatever your business use case may be, the portal is important for account functions, like seeing your usage details and billing.  \

Whichever option you select, you will be guided through the process of setting up an account, first.  You may use the navigation options at the left or below to select your guide of choice.
